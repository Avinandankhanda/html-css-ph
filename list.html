        <p>Apart from the Academic Excellence, West End High School bears the vision of inculcating in the students the right moral values so that they grow up to be able citizens of tomorrow. We make every effort to ensure that our students are global citizens with an Indian heart. As the medium of instruction is English, considerable care and caution is being taken to help the students develop the skills of learning English correctly in real life situations. Perfection is what we seek to import to our children who in their formative stage would feel encouraged to learn with a passion. In this era of careerism and cut throat competition in various professional spheres both communicative and creative English have a wider acceptability in modern times.
